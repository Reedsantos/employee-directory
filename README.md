## Description
This application uses React and a third party API ([Here](https://randomuser.me/)) to show a table of mock employees with random headshots, names, phone numbers, emails, and dates of birth. When the user clicks on "Name" then the list of employees will be ordered alphabetically by first name. There is also a search bar implemented so that the user can search employees by name, phone number, or email address. Because this is a react app, it will update the list of employees as the user is typing without having to press a search button.
